# Arduino-Iron-Man
Recreating various effects of the Iron Man suit from the movies for a kids costume.

At present time we only have the gauntlets "semi-working" with 2 modes. The gauntlets work in unison and the 2 modes are:

0: Slow pulse (Fade-In, Fade-Out), default, and 1: "Malfunction" (Random "sparks")

The code does not use delay() at all and could use some tweaking / improvement. The project is mainly for my son to learn C++ based programming with me and of course to give him an awesome Halloween costume.
